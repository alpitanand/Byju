Hi,

Thanks for the opportunity

To run the project, navigate to the directory

npm install
<--------Wait to complete------------>
npm start

No assumptions made, i tried to use JSON as it is, not to preprocess or store some part of it.

I wasn't able to make multi filter search like, searching the jobs available in Delhi and Pune.
However, we can search Banglore jobs with particular skill and year of experience.

P.s I didnt wrote any test, because i dont know how to, could have learnt but was busy in office works. Hoping not be regected due to this, could pick it up in a day or two.

Thanks again for the opportunity, hope you like the frontend.

Waiting for a reply.
